c === Adds task vertex to graph_4m_2crs_6j. The graph has less tasks than cores, hence
c === the flow changes should not propagate a lot through the graph. Moreover, the min
c === cost max flow does not have to move the other tasks because the placement before
c === the graph change is still the best.
